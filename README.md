# Web-Developer-Hub
An online reference for experienced programmers to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, and Socket.io with the minimum amount of information necessary

# What are its features?
This reference tool comes with several features including topics and examples for each language as well as a unique feature that no other tool has to offer. This website allows users to append sections to the page whenever they encounter information that they want to retain later on. For example, if a user searches up the syntax for centering HTML elements with CSS, they can simply add the results to the CSS reference page where it will stay if they create an account.

# Who is it for?
This is not meant for quick reference for experienced web developers but rather advanced programmers who are already comfortable with other languages and want to learn web development quickly. Since most resources online are meant for beginners who want to make websites, this tool assumes they are already comfortable with programming and simply provides them the minimal amount of information necessary to understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, and Socket.io.
